How can we polymorphism:
    1.Create a parent child relationship
    2.override the method in the child classes.
    3.Create array of all the child class objects and with the help of the loop you can call
      all the methods from all the child classes.
    4. If we don't want to provide the implementation on or more methods we can declare
      the child class as abstract as well
