Access Modifiers:
    Access modifiers are keywords in java that help us control the access of classes, variables, methods and other code
    block. There are 4 access levels in Java going in the following order most restrictive. we have three

    1) Private
        The access is limited to the class its in and it is the most restricted access modifier

    2) Default (not a keyword)
        When we don't use any access modifier keyword with a field or a method then default access is applied
        by java which means we can access this variable or method inside the same as well as in all the other
        classes that exist in the same package

    3) Protected
        When we have protected access modifier we can access that method or variable inside the same class and inside
        the other classes which are in the same package and inside the classes which are in different packages as well
        but they must have a extends relation with the original class.

    4) Public
        When we use the public access modifier we can use that field or method anywhere inside the same project and
        other packages/projects.
