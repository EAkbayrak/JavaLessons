What is a method?
    Method in java is a block of code(group of java statements). It defines behaviour

Why we should use methods:
    1) it helps us remove the duplicate code from our application. we just create a method and every time we need that
    contains that the logic.

    2) it also allows to write the code in the form of modules which makes the development of large applications easier

How to use the methods:
    1) First we create the method inside a class.
    2) We create the object of that class
    3) we call the method by writing the name of the object and a dot

class Calculator{

   void add(int x, int y){
    System.out.print(x+y)
}

public static void main(String [] args){

    Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
    calculator.add(10,20)
}}

Rules to create and use Methods:

    void ==> void is a return type and it is a must if you want to return a specific data write
    the same of that data type like for int we write int for String
    we write String and if we don't want to return anything we write void
    when we write a void we can't assign a method call toa variable.

    void add(int x, int y){
    System.out.print(x+y)
}

add => next we write the name of the method which can be anything  it should follow the rules
       for giving a name to a variable

()  => We specify the parameters here we can pass any data type inside these parenthesis
       They can be empty or filled in

{
    => System.out.print(x+y);
}

The body of the method that contains the java statement

add(int x, int y) => this part with the name of the method and its parameter is called signature

// if they're inside a class but outside the method is called a INSTANCE VARIABLE

If we create a variables inside a class are called LOCAL VARIABLES

if we use a static keyword then its a STATIC VARIABLES

==========================================================================

Types of variables java
    There are 3 types of variables
1) Local
2) Instance
3) static

Local:
If a variable is inside a method(void) or the methods parameter or a loop or a switch or in an if else condition.

instance:
If a variable is inside a class but outside a variable

Static:
If an instance variable has a static keyword with it then it is called a static variable

Why we learn about different types of variables:
    1) It helps us reduce the amount of RAM our Application will be using when it be running
    2) With the help of these variables we can pass information between methods of class
    3) Local variable occupy the memory for the shortest period of time as as soon as your method is
        done executing

Local variables:
How to use these
    Local: create inside block of code


Pros vs cons

Local variables:
    Advantage:
        They occupy the memory for the shortest period od time. Always try to use local variables when possible.

    Disadvantages:
       They are very limited in scope means we can't access them outside of method or that block of code

Instance variables:
    pros:
        They have broader scope as compared to local variables means we can access in all the methods of that class

    cons:
        They occupy the same in your ram for longer period of time

Static variables:
    pros:
        we can call static variables without creating an object of a class
        We can share a single variable between all the objects of a class
